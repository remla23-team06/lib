# lib

The library contains a VersionUtil class that has a `get_version method` to get its current function.
This library may be extended in the future. It builds to the newest version by tagging a Git commit with any version.
It will then automatically upload the build to the [Github Registry](ghcr.io) and [Pypi](test.pypi.org).
